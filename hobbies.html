    <h2>Computers</h2>
    <p> I realy like computers and technology, because when I grow up I want to do somthing that involses coding/computer science.<br> I think computers are cool because its just so cool how the pack all this technology into one package.<br></p>

    <h2>Tennis</h2>
    <p> I started to play tennis about 1 year ago, I got my interest because I wanted to try a lot of sports.<br> I played for about a year and I guess I just lost interest, but I still like to play tennis on my free time.<br></p>

    <h2>science</h2>
    <p> I realy love science, ever since I was little I wanted to be a scientist when I grew up. After I got a bit older I started to narrow down what scientist I wanted to be either a Geologist and an Astronomer.<br></p>
